I have already identified some lapses in my schema planning. Just planning out how I want the computer to read the data isn't enough; it occureed to me halfway through entering my data that I should maybe make the time zone values integers to aid in later calculations if I need to.

Typos were everywhere
just one wrong move and I have to start everything over again. Oy vey.

But I'm excited; I've wanted to make this kind of database for ages, and I am surprised to find that while SQL is arguably more tedious for input of data, it's more flexible in what you can do with the data than excel or numbers is (so far- it's possible that excel can export as an SQL data base, and I just don't know it...)

I still have some cleaning up to do in my data, and obviously a lot more entries to add... but I'm excited.
