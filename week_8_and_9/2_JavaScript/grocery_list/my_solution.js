// I worked on this challenge [by myself].
//I need a greocery list
//I need to be able to set a budget for the list
//I need to be able to add and remove items from the list
//I would like to be able to associate a price and a quantity with each item on the list
//I would like to be able to add up the total cost of the items on my list
//Maybe I could even have an alert that notifies me when the total cost of the items on my list has exceeded the budget

// 2. Pseudocode
//create an object groceryList
//give a property, budget that is initially set to 0
//give a


// 3. Initial Solution
function shoppingList(budget) {
	this.budget = budget;
	this.item = function(quantity, price); {
		this.quantity = quantity;
		this.price = price;
	}

	this.add = function(item); {
		
	}

}
