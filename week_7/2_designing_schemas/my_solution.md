## Release 4: Design your own Schema
Description of what you're modeling: 

I've always dreamt of having a flashcard set for the countries of the world, to help me memorize and stay up to date with them. You know- buff up on my geography.

Here we have a one-to-one schema for the countries of the world, and their capital cities, and a many-to-many model for countries and languages. One language can be spoken by many countries, and one country might speak many languages.
